				<p>We are a couple of regular ole folks on a mission to save the world through hiking the white mountain's high peaks. We started keeping track of the peaks we had summited in 2015. We had a lot of fun ticking of mountains on the list and figuring out creative a challenging ways to link them up. We also thought if would be fun to have and app to relive and visualize our experiences. We also thought it would be fun to have an interactive tool to help plan our next adventure and that is what inspired us to build NH High Peaks! </p>
